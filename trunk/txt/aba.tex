\section{Introduction}

ABA is a plant hormom which regulates, among other things, the closing
of stomata.  By triggering the production of ABA in crops it is hoped
to be possible to combine a significant reduction in water use, with a
moderate reduction in yield.

ABA is produced in the root system and has its effect in the canopy.
In the present implementation in Daisy transport, storage, and
degradation of ABA are all ignored in favor of a system where the ABA
concentration in the canopy is solely function of the current water
status in the root system.

\section{ABA production in soil}

Let $V$ represent the soil volume we are looking.  The soil volume
should as minimum include the entire root zone.  For every point in
$V$, Daisy will calculate three values: the volumetric water uptake
$S$, the root density $l$, and the water potential $h$.

Based on these values, we have several models for estimating ABA in
the stem (\aba{xylem}) from the conditions in the soil.

\subsection{Based on uptake location}

The first model is based directly on pot experiments where both
\aba{xylem} and the water potential ($h$) is measured.  The pots are
sufficiently small that the water potential is assumed to be the same
everywhere in the pot.  From this an empirical relationship
(\aba{uptake}) between $h$ and \aba{xylem} in the pots can be
developed.  By assuming the same relationship between ABA
concentration and uptaken water also holds in a field, we
get~\eqref{eq:aba_uptake}.

\begin{equation}
  \aba{xylem} = \frac{\int_V S \: \aba{uptake} \: dV}{\int_V S \: dV}
  \label{eq:aba_uptake}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Based on production in roots}

ABA is produced in the roots with a rate that depends in the water
potential (\aba{root}).  If we assume all the ABA produced ends up in
the stem, we can use \aba{root} to find \aba{xylem}, as
in~\eqref{eq:aba_root}.

\begin{equation}
  \aba{xylem} = \frac{\int_V l \: \aba{root} \: dV}{\int_V S \: dV}
  \label{eq:aba_root}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Based on production in soil}

Both \aba{uptake} and \aba{root} are special cases of calculating the
ABA contribution from the soil water potential, root uptake, and root
density.  We call this generalized function \aba{soil}, and the
generalized equation for~\eqref{eq:aba_soil}.

\begin{equation}
  \aba{xylem} = \frac{\int_V \aba{soil} \: dV}{\int_V S \: dV}
  \label{eq:aba_soil}
\end{equation}

\subsection{No ABA production}

The simplest model for ABA production is to assume no ABA is produced,
which also gives the simlest equation (\eqref{eq:aba_none}).

\begin{equation}
  \aba{xylem} = 0
  \label{eq:aba_none}
\end{equation}

\section{ABA effect in canopy}

\subsection{ABA effect on photosynthesis}

The ABA effect on photosynthesis is through a factor (\aba{cond})
which is multiplied to the stomata conductance.  The factor is
calculated as decribed in \eqref{eq:aba-cond}.

\begin{equation}
  \aba{cond} = e^{-k \aba{xylem}}
  \label{eq:aba-cond}
\end{equation}

\subsection{ABA effect on transpiration}

This effect has yet to be implemented.  Currently transpiration is
calculated based on an energy balance, and limited by the root systems
potential water uptake.  Stomata conductance is ignored.
