\begin{abstract}
  Partial root zone drying (PRD) is an irrigation technique that in some
  cases can increase the water usage efficiency.  A \twod{} model of
  water movement in the soil is needed to predict how to most
  efficiently apply irrigation in order to achieve the PRD effect.  This
  model must include a \twod{} root model.  In this paper we extend an
  empirical root density distribution based on densely populated
  homogeneous fields (\oned{}) to row crops (\twod{}).  The row crops
  are modeled as having a uniform ensity in the direction parallel to
  the rows, but variable in the direction perpendicular to the row.  In
  each case we demonstrate how to find the distribution parameters from
  the root dry matter and the size of the root zone.

  The SAFIR EU project included \twod{} root density measurements
  performed at two sites, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
  (CAAS) and the Chinese Agricultural University (CAU), for two
  experimental years and on multiple plots.  Both the \oned{} and
  \twod{} model are fitted to these datasets.  Based on a statistical
  F-test we conclude that the \twod{} model is superior when the root
  zone width is less than the distance between rows.  The median $R^2$
  for all the examined datasets is 0.86, and a visual inspection
  confirms that the model catches both the horizontal and vertical root
  density variation pattern.

\section{Model theory}

Our goal is to describe the two dimensional root density distribution
for row crops in terms of root dry mass, root zone depth, and root
zone width.  These values can be provided by a general crop growth
model (like the one found in Daisy), and furthermore have the
advantage that they are easily understood concepts.  However, first we
will describe for a traditional one dimensional root density
distribution in terms of root dry mass and root zone width.  This will
provide a reference to compare with later.

\subsection{Densely populated fields}
\label{sec:model-1d}

In accordance with \cite{gp74}, the root density distribution $L_z$
for a crop can be described by
\begin{equation}
  L_z = L_0\, e^{-a z}
  \label{eq:g+p}
\end{equation}
where $L_0$ is the root density at the soil surface, $a$ is a
distribution parameter, and $z$ is the depth below soil surface.

We here assume that the density is uniformly distributed on the
horizontal plane, an assumption that fails with e.g.\ row crops.

The parameters $a$ and $L_0$ will both vary with time.  For a
production oriented simulation model like
Daisy~\citep{daisy-fertilizer,daisy-ems}, it can be more convenient to
specify the density in terms of accumulated root dry matter $M_r$ and
total root depth $d_c$, as described in \cite{daisy-def} or the
following.

We define the root depth at the lowest depth where the root density is
at above specified threshold $L_m$.  By inserting this in
\eqref{eq:g+p}, we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = L_{d_c} = L_0\, e^{-a d_c}
  \label{eq:root-depth}
\end{equation}

We convert the root mass to root length $l_r$ by assuming the specific
root length $S_r$ is a known constant (rather than varying with depth)
\begin{equation}
  l_r = S_r \, M_r
  \label{eq:root-length}
\end{equation}

The total root length is also the integral of the root density over
the profile
\begin{equation}
  l_r = \int_0^{\infty} L_z \: dz 
      = \int_0^{\infty} L_0\, e^{-a z} \, dz 
      = \frac{L_0}{a}
  \label{eq:root-integral}
\end{equation}

By inserting the expression we get for $L_0$ from
\eqref{eq:root-integral} in \eqref{eq:root-depth} we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = l_r \, a \, e^{-a d_c}
  \label{eq:a-only}
\end{equation}

If we substitute $W = -a d_c$ and isolate the known values on the right
side this gives us
\begin{equation}
   W e^W = - L_m \frac{d_c}{l_r}
  \label{eq:Lambert}
\end{equation}
The solution to this equation with regard to $W$ happens to be the
definition of the Lambert-W function \citep{euler83,lambert58}.  The
function on the left hand side of the equation is depicted on
figure~\ref{fig:W}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_W}
  \caption{$W e^W$}
  \label{fig:W}
\end{figure}

Since we now know the value for $W$m we can find the desired density
parameters $L_0$ and $a$ by substituting back
\begin{eqnarray}
   a   &=& -W / d_c\\\label{eq:a-solved}
   L_0 &=& \frac{L_m}{e^{-a d_c}} = L_m e^{a d_c}\label{eq:L0-found}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Numeric solution to $W$}

We start by dividing the functions into monotonic intervals by finding
the derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d W\, e^W}{dW} = e^W + W e^W
  \label{eq:derived-W}
\end{equation}
The equation
\begin{equation}
  e^W + W e^W = 0
  \label{eq:derived-W-solutions}
\end{equation}
has one solution, $W=-1$. The expression $W\, e^W$ is decreasing below
$-1$ and increasing above $-1$.  Thus, $W=0$ is a global minimum.

Since $\lim_{Q\to-\infty} W\,e^W=0$ we get a single solution when
$-L_m \frac{d_c}{l_r}$ is exactly at the bottom point ($-1 e^{-1}$), two
when it is above (it is never positive), and none when it is below.
The later situation corresponds to the case where there are
insufficient root $l_r$ to satisfy the minimal root density $L_m$
within the given root zone $d_c$.

Both solutions are valid, but represent different distributions.
\begin{itemize} 
\item The solution for $W < -1$ represents a large $a$ parameter. From
  \eqref{eq:L0-found} we see this also means $L_0$ is large.  Thus,
  the solution corresponds to a root zone with a high density near the
  top that decreases rapidly to $L_m$ at the bottom of the root zone,
  and continues to decrease so only a small contribution to the total
  root length from below he root zone.
\item The solution for $W > -1$ (and thus small values of $a$ and
  $L_0$) corresponds to a low root density near the top that
  decreases slowly, and thus gives a larger contribution to the total
  root length from below the root zone.
\end{itemize}
As the total root length increases, pressing $W$ towards $0$ or
$-\infty$, the difference between the solutions grow.  When there is
just enough roots to satisfy the constraints at $W = -1$, the two
solutions converges to one.  As we like our roots to stay mostly
within the root zone, we choose the solution for $W < -1$.  We can
thus find $W$ numerically using Newton's method and an initial guess
of $-2$.

\subsubsection{Limited growth}
\label{sec:soillim}

The distribution in \eqref{eq:g+p} implies a gradual decrease of roots
going towards but never reaching zero.  There are two problems with
this.  The first one is empirical, for some soils it doesn't match what
we observe, rather than a gradual decrease, there is sharp decrease at
a specific depth, as the roots are unable to penetrate further
down. The other one is practical, too large a root zone makes
computation impractical.

The way we model the first issue is to divide the root depth into a
crop specific and soil independent potential root depth $d_c$, and soil
specific and crop independent maximum root depth $d_s$.  The actual
root depth $d_a$ is then the shallowest of these two.
\begin{equation}
  d_a = \min (d_c, d_s)
  \label{eq:actual-depth}
\end{equation}

We now create a modified root density function $L_z^\prime$ by defining it to
zero below $d_a$, and a $L_z$ scaled to preserve mass balance above.
\begin{equation}
  L_z^\prime =
  \begin{cases}
    k^\prime L_z & \text{if $z \leq d_a$}\\
    0 & \text{if $z > d_a$}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:limited-depth}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  k^\prime = \frac{l_r}{\int_0^{d_a} L_z \, dz}
  \label{eq:scale-factor}
\end{equation}
thus solving both problems.

\subsection{Row crops}

We can describe a row crop with a two dimensional model by assuming that
the plants are densely packed in the row.  Our second dimension $x$ is
horizontal, orthogonal to the row.  The root density at a specific point
can be denoted $L_{z,x}$, and we choose a coordinate system where $L_{0,0}$
is the the root density in the top center of the row.

We then define the following root distribution
\begin{equation}
  L_{z,x} = L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x}
  \label{eq:Lzx}
\end{equation}
where $a_z$ and $a_z$ control the density decrease in the two
dimensions.

\subsubsection{Finding the parameters}

To find the parameters $a_z$, $a_x$ and $L_{0,0}$, we assume as before
that the root depth and root mass is known, and now additionally that
the root zone radius at soil surface $w_c$ is known.  We define the root
zone depth $d_c$ to be the depth right below the row ($x = 0$) where the
root density is $L_m$.  As $x=0$ is the place where \eqref{eq:Lzx}
predicts the highest density, the average root density at that depth
will be well below $L_m$.  Similarly, we define the radius $w_c$ as the
horizontal distance from the row where the root density at the surface
($z = 0$)
\begin{equation}
  L_m = L_{d,0} = L_{0,r}
  \label{eq:minroot}
\end{equation}
See figure~\ref{fig:row} for an illustration.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{row}
  \caption{The \twod{} root zone of a single row of crops.  The x-axis
    denote horizontal distance to the row, and the z-axis height above
    ground level.  The highest root density ($L_{0,0}$) can be found
    in the row at ground level.  The root density density decrease
    exponentially, with both horizontal and vertical distance.  Four
    root density contours are shown.  The three innermost contours
    each represent a fixed decrease in root density.  The last contour
    represents the threshold value, $L_m$, and defines both the root
    zone depth ($d_c$) and the root zone radius ($w_r$).}
  \label{fig:row}
\end{figure}

The total root length on one side of the row ($l_R$), which we assume
is known from our crop model, is the integral of the root density over
the half plane
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    l_R &=& \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} L_{z,x} \: dz \, dx \\
        &=& \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x} \: dz \, dx\\
        &=& \frac{L_{0,0}}{a_z a_x}\\ 
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:root-integral2}
\end{equation}
Thus \eqref{eq:Lzx} can be rewritten 
\begin{equation}
  L_{z,x} = l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x}  
  \label{eq:azx}
\end{equation}

By using \eqref{eq:azx} in \eqref{eq:minroot} we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  L_m &=& l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_z d} \\\label{eq:Ld0}
  L_m &=& l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_x r}\label{eq:L0r}
\end{eqnarray}
Thus $e^{-a_z d} = e^{-a_x r}$ or
\begin{equation}
  a_x = \frac{d_c}{w_c} a_z
  \label{eq:aztoax}
\end{equation}

By inserting \eqref{eq:aztoax} in \eqref{eq:Ld0} we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = l_R\, a_z\, \frac{d}{r} a_z \, e^{-a_z d}
  \label{eq:azeq1}
\end{equation}

If we substitute 
\begin{equation}
  Q = -a_z d
  \label{eq:Qaz}
\end{equation}
and isolate the known values on the right side, this gives us:
\begin{equation}
  Q^2\, e^Q = L_m \frac{d \, r}{l_R}
  \label{eq:logsquare}
\end{equation}
The left hand side expression is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:Q}.
Unlike \eqref{eq:Lambert}, nobody bothered to give the solution to
\eqref{eq:logsquare} a name.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_Q}
  \caption{$Q^2 e^Q$}
  \label{fig:Q}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Numeric solution to $Q$}

We start by dividing the functions into monotonic intervals by finding
the derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d (Q^2\, e^Q)}{dQ} = 2 Q e^Q + Q^2 e^Q
  \label{eq:derived}
\end{equation}
The equation
\begin{equation}
  2 Q e^Q + Q^2 e^Q = 0
  \label{eq:derived-solutions}
\end{equation}
has two solutions, $Q=0$ and $Q=-2$, and the expression $Q^2\, e^Q$ is
increasing below $-2$, decreasing between $-2$ and $0$, and increasing
above $0$. Thus, $Q=0$ is a local (and in this case also global)
minimum, and $Q=-2$ is a local maximum.

We are not interested in positive values for $Q$, they correspond to
negative values for $a_z$, and the simplification in
\eqref{eq:root-integral2} are only valid if $a_z > 0$.  

Since $\lim_{Q\to-\infty} Q^2\,e^Q=0$ we get a single negative
solution when $L_m \frac{d \, r}{l_R}$ is exactly at the top point
($2^2 e^{-2}$), two when it is smaller (it is never negative), and
none when it is larger.  The later situation corresponds to the case
where there are insufficient root $l_R$ to satisfy the minimal root
density $L_m$ within the given root zone $d\, r$. 

Both negative solutions are valid, but represent different
distributions.
\begin{itemize} 
\item The solution for $Q < -2$ represents a large $a_z$ (and thus
  also $a_x$) parameter. From \eqref{eq:root-integral2} we see this
  also means $L_{0,0}$ is large.  Thus, the solution corresponds to a
  root zone with a high density near the center that decreases rapidly
  to $L_m$ near the edge of the root zone, and continues to decrease
  so only a small contribution to the total root length fro outside
  the root zone.
\item The solution for $Q > -2$ (and thus small values of $a_x$, $a_x$
  and $L_{0,0}$) corresponds to a low root density near the center
  that decreases slowly, and thus gives a larger contribution to the
  total root length from outside the root zone.  
\end{itemize}
As the total root length increases, pressing $Q$ towards $0$ or
$-\infty$, the difference between the solutions grow.  When there is just
enough roots to satisfy the constraints at $Q = -2$, the two solutions
converges to one.  As we like our roots to stay mostly within the root
zone, we choose the solution for $Q < -2$.

We can find $Q$ numerically using Newton's method and an initial guess
of $-3$.  From that we can find $a_z$ from \eqref{eq:Qaz}, $a_x$ from
\eqref{eq:aztoax}, and $L_{0,0}$ from \eqref{eq:root-integral2}.

\subsubsection{Multiple rows}
\label{sec:model-rows}

If the rows are close enough, the root systems will overlap as shown
on figure~\ref{fig:zigzag}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_L}
  \caption{The x-axis represents the distance from a row to the
    midpoint between it and the row to its right.  The y-axis is the
    root density for roots originating in a specific row.  The top
    line represents the roots from the row itself.  The next line the
    roots from the row to the right.  And the last line the roots from
    the row to the left.  In theory, all the rows on the field will
    contribute some roots to the interval.  The root density in the
    interval will be the sum of all the individual contributions.}
  \label{fig:zigzag}
\end{figure}

If $R$ is the distance between rows, and we assume an infinite number
of identical rows, this can be expressed by the equation
\begin{equation}
  L^*_{z,x} =
    \begin{cases}
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (L_{z,x + i R} + L_{z,R + i R - x}) & \text{if $x < R/2$}\\
                                                    0  & \text{if $x \geq R/2$}
    \end{cases}
  \label{eq:Lzxstar}
\end{equation}

Using \eqref{eq:Lzx} and the rules for geometric series we can rewrite
the first case to get rid of the sum
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rl}
     & \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (L_{z,x + i R} + L_{z,R + i R - x})\\
%%    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} 
%%       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (e^{-a_x (x + i R)} + e^{-a_x (R + i R - x)})\\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (       e^{-a_x x} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i R} 
                          + e^{-a_x (R - x)} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i R})\\
%%    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (R - x)})
%%       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i R}) \\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (R - x)})
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} ((\frac{1}{e})^{a_x R})^i\\
    =& \frac{L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (R - x)})}
            {1 - \frac{1}{e}^{a_x R}}\\
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:Lzxstar-solved}
\end{equation}
Two examples of the resulting root density distribution can be found
on figure~\ref{fig:tworows}.

\subsubsection{Mapping between the models}
\label{sec:mapping}

We would like to retain our original distribution when ignoring the x
dimension.  We couldn't do that when looking only at the root system
for a single row, as it is infinitely wide and thus has an average
density of zero.  However, if we look at the roots of single row, we
get
\begin{equation}
  L_z = \frac{2 \int_0^{\infty} L_{z,x}\, dx}{R}
  \label{eq:x-integrated}
\end{equation}
We multiply by two as we assume the two sides of the rows are
identical.  By integrating to $\infty$ rather than just $R/2$ we do
include roots from outside the row.  However, because the system has
an infinite number of identical rows, the amount of roots from the
crop outside its own row is exactly the same as the amount of roots
from other rows inside the row we are examining.

Inserting \eqref{eq:Lzx} and \eqref{eq:g+p} in \eqref{eq:x-integrated} we get
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    L_0\, e^{-a z} &=& \frac{2}{R} \int_{0}^{\infty} L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x x} dx\\
                 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z}}{R} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x x} dx\\
                 &=& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} \frac{0 - 1}{-a_x}\\
                 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}}{R a_x} e^{-a_z z}\\
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:1d2d}
\end{equation}
So we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  a_z &=& a\\\label{eq:azisa}
  L_{0,0} &=& ½ a_x R L_0\\\label{eq:L00L0}
  L_0 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}}{a_x R}\label{eq:L0L00}
\end{eqnarray}
as the equations to use when switching between the one and two
dimensional descriptions.

\section{Data description and methodology}

Root sampling were performed at two experimental fields, the first
being operated by the Chinese Academy for Agricultural Sciences (CAAS)
and located near Zhengzhou in the Henan province, and the second
operated by the Chinese Agricultural University and located near
Beijing.  Potatoes were grown at the CAAS site, while the CAU site
were growing tomatoes.

\subsection{Treatments}

The SAFIR project had two main aspects, the first was the reuse of
waste water for irrigation, with emphasis on human safety.  The
treatments were designed with sufficient fertilization, so that the
constituents of the waste water would be unlikely to affect crop
growth.  Hence, for crop growth the different irrigation sources could
be seen as replicates.  The second aspect was how the design of the
irrigation system could save water.  Two irrigation methods and three
irrigation strategies were considered.  The irrigation methods were
subsurface drip irrigation and ufrrow irrigation.  The irrigation
strategies were full irrigation, deficit irrigation (70\% of full
irrigation), and partial rootzone drying (like deficit, but altering
sides of the crop). 

At the CAAS site, root density sampling was perforemed in 2006 and
2008.  Unfortunately, the 2006 harvest failed, and the measured root
densities were below expectations (most measurements showed root
densities so low, that they would be considered for outside the root
zone by the model), so we have discarted that data set.  All
treatments were done with three replicates, but due to the labour
intensive nature of root density sampling, it was only performed on
selected plots as outlined in table~\ref{tab:caas2008treatments}
and~\ref{tab:cautreatments}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{CAAS 2008 treatments with root density measurements.

    also used a sand filter (SF), addition plus removal of heavy

\subsection{Root sampling}

Both sites used ridge systems.  To describe it, we use a coordinate
system with the x-axis ortogonal to the ridges with x=0 cm representing
the top of the ridge, the y-axis along the ridges with y=0 cm
representing the plant position, and the z-axis representing height
above the undisturbed ground level, positive upwards.  At the CAAS
site, roots were sampled in a $3\times2\times7$ grid.  The sampling
along the x-axis corresponded to the top of the ridge, the middle of
the ridge wall, and the bottom of the valley (x=0 cm, x=18.75 cm,
x=37.5 cm).  The sampling along the y-axis corresponded to the plant
location, and the middle between two plants (y=0 cm, y=15 cm).  At the
z-axis, there were sampling in ten  cm intervals starting just below
the unditurbed ground level (z=-5 cm) at the top of the ridge, and
starting 10 and 20 cm lower for sampling at the middle and bottom of
the ridge system.  The sampling points are illustrated on
figure~\ref{fig:sample-caas}.  A the CAU site, the sampling were done
in a cross shape, with five sample locations at the top of the ridge
(x=0 cm; and y=-20 cm, y=-10 cm, y=0 cm, y=10 cm, y=20 cm), and five sample
locations across the ridge system (y=0 cm; and x=-30 cm, x=-15 cm,
x=15 cm, x=15 cm, x=30 cm).  The sampling along the top of the ridge
started at z=15 cm, that is above undisturbed ground level.  The
sampling across the ridge started at z=-5 cm.  The samplings were
performed in 10  cm intervals, the lowest varied between plots and with
the horizontal distance to the plant, the lowest were at z=-55 cm. See
figure~\ref{fig:sample-cau}.

\subsection{Fitting the data to the model}

The root density model presented in this paper assumes flat soil.  To
solve this, a virtual soil surface corresponding to the undisturbed
ground level (z=0 cm) was used in the model.  Furthermore, the root
density model is \twod{}, while the root data for both sites is
\threed{}.  The root model describes the x-axis (position between row)
and the z-axis (height above ground), but not the y-axis (position
within row).  For the CAAS dataset, we have similar datasets for two
two y-values, and we have included both datasets, thus fitting a
\twod{} model to a \threed{} dataset.  From the point of view of the
model, we have two observations for each (x, z) pair.  For the CAU
dataset, and the observations where y$\neq$0 cm have x=0 cm.
Including these would give an unbalanced dataset.  So for the CAU
dataset we have only used the measurements where y=0 cm.  Furthermore,
we have ignored the measurements with z$>$0 cm, as illustrated on
figure~\ref{fig:sample-cau}.  For each year, we created datasets for
each plot, plus additional datasets consisting of all measurements
from the same site, in effect a dataset where we consideret the
different treatments as replicates.

We used fixed values for the minimal root density ($L_m = 0.1
cm/cm^3$) and specific root lenght ($S_r = 100 m/g$).  The distance
between rows ($R$) were taken from the experimental setup, 75 cm for
CAAS and 80 cm for CAU.  Given these, we could create a function that
calculated the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) for the \oned{}
model based on root dry mass ($M_r$) and root zone depth ($d_c$) as
described in section~\ref{sec:model-1d}.  Imposing a soil limit (see
section~\ref{sec:soillim} did not improve the fit, so we used $d_a =
d_c$.  For the \twod{} model, we created a similar function based on
section~\ref{sec:model-rows} that in addition took the horizontal root
zone radius ($w_c$) as a parameter.  For each dataset, we found the
parameter values that gave the highest $R^2$ using
the~\cite{nelder1965simplex} algorithm.

The \oned{} model has two free variables ($M_r$ and $d_c$) as used
above, while the \twod{} model has three free variables ($M_r$, $d_c$,
and $w_c$).  Furthermore, as demonstrated in
section~\ref{sec:mapping}, the \oned{} model is special case of the
\twod{} model.  This means we can use an F-test on the hypothesis that
the \twod{} provide no significant advantage over the \oned{} model.
We used $p=0.05$ as the test criterie.

No clear pattern emerge on the effect of the irrigation treatment on
the root zone.  The 2008 CAU data points toward a contraction of the
root zone for all treatments between the first and the second
sampling, see figure~\ref{fig:cau2008}.  This pattern is partly
supported by the 2006 CAU data.

\section{Discussion and concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item TODO: Make text less of a summary.
\item TODO: Uncertainty fitting flat geometry model to ridge reality.
\item TODO: Root mass in top of ridge not taken into account.
\item TODO: CAU: Distribution along y axis not taken into account
  (overstimate root mass).
\item TODO: Application in analysis.
\item TODO: Difference in treatments outside scope of this article.
\item TODO: Application in model.
\end{itemize}

We first presented a simple \twod{} extension of the parametric
\oned{} model found by \cite{gp74}, and shown how to calculate the
distribution parameters for the model from root mass, root zone depth,
and root zone width.

We then examined 28 datasets, plus five more that were created by
aggregating data from different plots.  The datasets spanned two
sites, two years, and two different sample dates within the same
growing season.  For the CAAS site we 8 \threed{} dataset, plus one
aggregated dataset.  For the CAU site we have 20 \twod{} datasets,
plus 4 aggregated dataset.  

The \twod{} model was a significant improvement over the \oned{} model
for all the aggregated datasets, half the \threed{} datasets, and 17
of the 20 \twod{} datasets.  The \twod{} model is never worse than the
\oned{} model.  For all the cases where we were unable to show a
statistically significant improvement for the \twod{} model, the best
fit for the root zone width was at least three times the distance
between rows, indicating a situation where there root zones of the
different plant rows were fully merged.  The $R^2$ values range from
0.73 to 0.96 for 27 of 28 datasets, with the last dataset having $R^2
= 0.30$.  For the aggregated datasets, $R^2$ range from 0.56 to 0.92.  

Based on this we believe the proposed model is useful for the intended
purpose of modelling water dynamics in row crops with PRD irrigation.

\section{Software and data availability}

Software to estimate root mass and root zone depth from 1D root
density data, and in addition root zone width from 2D root density
data, can be found at \url{http://www.daisy-model.org/} (look under
\texttt{Wiki}, \texttt{\textsc{gp2d}}).  Also supported is estimating
root density distribution from root mass, root zone depth, and
optionally, root zone width.  The program code is written in
\cplusplus{} and is covered by on open source license (\textsc{gnu
  lgpl}), so it can be freely incorporated in other models.

The root density data from the two field sites will be made available
at \url{http://www.safir4eu.org/} from TODO-XXXX-DATE
(look under \texttt{Trials}).
