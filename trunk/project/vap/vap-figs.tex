\chapter{Introduction}

The Danish Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme (PLAP) has been
monitoring drain and soil water since 1999 at six (five ongoing)
locations in order to evaluate the leaching risk of pesticides.
Pesticides are found in concentrations above 0.1 $\mu$g/L in drain
water, whereas such concentrations are rarely found in the horizontal
filters 3.5 meter below the surface.

In order to better understand the system, and eventually how the
measurements can be better used for assessing potential risk of
contamination of drinking water, the Daisy agricultural model has been
extended by including support for those processes we assume are
relevant for transport of pesticides from surface to drain pipes.

To test our understanding as embedded in the model, as well as the
applicability of the model to the PLAP sites, two PLAP sites, four
pesticides, and two years of data have been modelled as a pilot
project.  Our hypothesis is here that we can explain the measured data
with the model.

The most significant measured results are from the Estrup site, so
that was chosen as one of the sites to be calibrated.  We wanted to
use the same years for both sites to see the results of similar
climate on two different locations.  Hourly weather data from the site
had to be present, both for the modelling period and for one growth
season before for "`warmup"'.  The initial choice of F{\aa}rdrup as
the second site was rejected, as it was not possible to get sufficient
site-sepcific weather data.  Furthermore, we wanted the same
pesticides on both sites, and both weakly and strongly sorbing
pesticides represented.  Glyphosate had to be one of them.

Based on these criteria, we chose Silstrup and Estrup, drain seasons
2000-2001 and 2001-2002, with the pesticides glyphosate, fenpropimorph,
dimethoate, and metamitron.

Both sites are described in details in \citet{lindhardt2001}. An
overview of the measured data can be found in \citet{vap2009}.  Estrup
is a pedologically rich site, containing both areas with sand and
clay, peat, thin layers of chalk, and even sand fill from railroad
construction.  Silstrup is also heterogeneous, but less so, with high
(for Danish soils) levels of clay dominating the area.  Figure 5.13 of
\citet{lindhardt2001} is illustrative.  Based on two profiles,
Silstrup shows the second largest variation in soil texture, but is
consistently the highest or second highest in clay content among the
PLAP sites.  Estrup, on the other hand, shows even larger variation,
and features both the the highest and lowest clay content among the
four loamy soil sites.

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Comparison between simulated and measured data}

It is possible to explain the measured data based on the processes
included in the present model, with some caveats
\begin{itemize}
\item The high degree of heterogeneity at the Estrup site would
  require a detailed 3D model of the entire area to model
  mechanistically.  The current 2D model setup can at best be viewed
  as ``effective parameters''.
\item The simulated second year drain season for Silstrup is too
  short. This is particularly noticeable for the Bromide measurements.
\item Measurements at both sites show
  (figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-weekly2} and~\ref{fig:Estrup-weekly}) that
  the initial glyphosate event is followed by a couple of weeks with
  addition drain leaching.  The model show the same, but underestimate
  the size of the later events.  This could be due to easily
  remobilizable glyphosate in proximity of the preferential transport
  system, a process we have not implemented in our model, or for
  Estrup, due to the peat below part of site, which hasn't been
  included in the setup.  As glyphosate doesn't sorb to organic matter
  \citep{gjettermann2009}, any glyphosate that finds it way down to
  the peat through biopores, may potentially slowly move towards the
  drain pipes.  For Estrup, Daisy continues to underestimate the late
  events for the rest of the first drain season.
\item Bromide is found in some of the horizontal filters at 3.5 meters
  depth at both sites in the first measurements after application of
  Bromide.  No pesticides are generally found at this depth though.
  It does indicate a transport way for non-sorbing solutes that we
  cannot currently model.  One possibility is large scale fractures,
  this suggestion is supported by other work at GEUS.
\end{itemize}

Sine we have been developing the model (adding new processes) based on
the measured data, the work presented in this report cannot count as a
model validation.

\section{Deep leaching of pesticides}

Figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-leak150} and~\ref{fig:Estrup-leak150} show
some deep leaching of pesticides in Silstrup, but apart from a single
event, none for Estrup.  If we look at
figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-C-Metamitron-2000},~\ref{fig:Silstrup-C-Glyphosate-2001},
and~\ref{fig:Estrup-C-Glyphosate-2000} we see the metamitron moving
downward but being diluted in the process.  The glyphosate is not
visibly moving from beyond the end of the biopores at either site.
The high concentration at the end the biopores is likely mostly a
reflection of a limitation in the model, we have specified all
biopores to end in the same depth, in reality they will end at
different depths.

\section{Process understanding}

Apart from the significance of biopores for pesticide leaching, it is
interesting to note how the two sites are dominated by different
processes.  For Silstrup, surface processes (crust formation, litter,
and overland flow) were dominating the system.  For Estrup, the
majority of the measured leaching can be adequately explained by what
happens in the plow layer.  See also the figures and discussion in
appendix~\ref{app:plot-2d} for further analysis of the simulated
processes.

\section{Localized pesticide parameters}

Due to a communication snafu, we were not aware of the local estimates
of sorption and degradation of some pesticides, documented
in~\citet{vap2003}.  This concerns dimethoate at Estrup, for which we
have no significant measurements, and metamitron at Silstrup, for
which we \emph{do} have significant measurements.  Furthermore,
fenpropimorph has been analyzed at the four remaining PLAP sites.
Both topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (80-100 cm) were analyzed.

A \kd{} value was estimated for both soil depths, but \koc{} only for
the topsoil.  For dimethoate sorption at Estrup, \koc{} was estimated
to 86 mL/g, the value used in Daisy was 30 mL/g.  For metamitron at
Silstrup, \koc{} was estimated to 160 mL/g.  The \kd{} value is 3.5
mL/g in the topsoil, and 0.4 mL/g in the subsoil.  As the organic
content of the subsoil is also 10 \% of the topsoil, using the \koc{}
value seems sensible.  In Daisy we used a \kd{} of 4.0 mL/g.  For
fenpropimorph, the four sites show a span of \koc{} from 1532 mL/g
(Jyndevad) to 7496 mL/g (Sl{\ae}ggerup).  The value used in Daisy is
2401 mL/g.

For dimethoate at Estrup the DT50 value was estimated to be less than 2
days in the top soil, and 74 days in the subsoil.  The value used in
Daisy was 7.2 days in the top soil, which will translate into 24 days
in the subsoil using the \focus{} depth function.  Note that the
\focus{} depth function increase DT50 to infinity (no degradation)
below 1 meter, just under the measured interval of subsoil.
Metamitron decomposition was not analyzed.  For fenpropimorph, DT50
was over 300 for all analyzed subsoils.  For the topsoil, DT50 varied
between 15 and 379.  The value used in Daisy was 25.5 days for the
topsoil, corresponding to 85 days for the subsoil.

We do not believe the difference in parameter values between what was
used by Daisy and what was measured for dimethoate at Estrup are
sufficiently large to signifiantly change the simulated drain
leaching.  However, using the lower measured sorption rate (especially
in the subsoil) for metamitron at Silstrup would likely result in
larger simulated drain leaching, which is not good as we already
overestimate it.  The values used in Daisy for fenpropimorph are
within the span measured at the other sites, except that degradation
apparently descrease faster with depth than asserted by \focus{}.

\section{Further work}

The surface processes (flow, litter storage, degradation) are very
important, especially for the Silstrup site.  This was discovered
late, hence the solutions have been less carefully worked out than we
would desire.  The flow model is nearly non-existing (it just
distribute excess water uniformly on the field), the litter storage
model is based on millet growing in Brazil, and may or may not be the
right choice for spring barley growing in Denmark.  The surface
pesticide degradation parameters were based on an unrelated pesticide
that happened to be in the Daisy pesticide library.

We also need to use localized pesticide parameters like those
available from \citet{vap2003}, as well as get better knowledge of
colloid transport, different sorption sites, and sorption kinetics.
The values for the later are mostly based on a desire to test the
mechanisms in the model, than qualified estimates of the physical and
chemical properties of the system.
