\begin{abstract}
  Measurements of pesticides in drain pipe outlets is is integral to
  the Danish Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme (PLAP).  In order
  to relate these meaurements with deep leaching of pesticides, and
  thus the potential risk to tap water quality, modelling is needed.
  The Daisy simulation model has been extended to handle new processes
  relevant to strongly sorbing pesticides, among those biopores,
  surface litter as pesticide storage reservoir, and surface seal
  formation.  The extended model is set up for one of the PLAP sites
  (Silstrup), and measured values for Glyphosate are show together
  with simulated values with and without inclusion of the surface seal
  and litter pack processes, demonstrating how these are essential for
  the results.  Finally we demonstrate how the results is very
  sensitive to adjustment parameters for the litter pack model.
