* Crop

MACRO uses a site specific crop parameterization.  This was abandoned
in favor of the generic crop parameterizations available in Daisy,
with two exeptions: Emergence and harvest dates were used in the Daisy
management module, and a soil imposed max root penetration depth were
estimated from MACRO parameters.
