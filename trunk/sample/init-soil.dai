;; or hydrogen.

  ;; A third way to initialize NO3-N and NH4-N is "M", which is mass per

  ;; density or soil water content affect it.

  ;; Finally we initialize the soil heat.  This is rarely used.

;; The default value of NH4 is 5 [ppm], which is appromiately 5% of
;; the legal limit in drinking water.  The default value for NO3 is 50
;; [ppm], which corresponds to 50% of the legal limit in drinking
;; water. 

;; The default value for soil water depend on the selected groundwater
;; model.  Near groundwater the soil water is assumed to be in
;; equilibrium with the groundwater.  Above the bottom meter, field
;; capacity (pF 2) is assumed.

;; The default value for soil heat is calculated from the average
;; temperature properties specified by the weather module, and the
;; termic properties of the soil, which is usually calcluaed from the
;; texture information.
