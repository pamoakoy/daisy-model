* Pesticides

Test compounds 

     1 (KOC=15, DT50=6, 3 kg/ha, Potatoes),
     2 (KOC=91, DT50=26, 1 kg/ha, Maize) and
     3 (KOC=1, DT50=1.5, 1 kg/ha, Winter Wheat)

were compared.  We used Daisy defaults for all other pesticide
properties.

The application dates and amounts from FOCUS were used in both simulations.

* Colloids.

The colloid model and default parameters are identicfal to the
Rørrendegård setup, adjusted for clay content.  The colloid transport
model is identical to the Rørrendegård and VAP setup.

* Soil

MACRO parameters were used for the micropores, with one exception.
The top 8 cm of the first horizon below the plow layer was designated
a plow pan, and given a conductivity of 10% of the rest of the
horizons. The biopores module parameterized for Rørrende was used for
macropores.

* Crop and management

MACRO uses a site specific crop parameterization.  This was abandoned
in favor of the generic crop parameterizations available in Daisy,
with two exeptions: Emergence and harvest dates were used in the Daisy
management module, and a soil imposed max root penetration depth were
estimated from MACRO parameters.

The irrigation dates and amounts from FOCUS were used in both simulations.

6 years warmup with the same crop and pesticide application were used
in both simulations.  Irrigation were adjutsed to the weather each
year.  Crop emergence and harvest was not.
