ddf-0.0 -- Fake root density observations for rootmatch.dai

# We have fake-measured root density in two intervals. The top
# interval is between 10 and 20 cm below surface and the bottom
# interval is between 25 and 35 cm below surface. This has been done
# at the center of the row, 10 cm from the row, and 20 cm from the
# row. Six measurements total.
