\begin{abstract}
  We extend an empirical root density distribution based on densely
  populated homogeneous fields (\oned{}) to row crops (\twod{}).  The
  row crops are modeled as having a uniform density in the direction
  parallel to the rows, but variable in the plane perpendicular to the
  row.  In each case we demonstrate how to find the distribution
  parameters from the root dry matter and the size of the root zone.

  \twod{} root density measurements was performed at two sites for two
  experimental years and multiple plots.  Both the \oned{} and \twod{}
  model are fitted to these datasets.  Based on a statistical F-test
  we conclude that the \twod{} model is superior when the root zone
  width is less than the distance between rows.  The median of the
  coefficient of determination for all the examined datasets is 0.86,
  and a visual inspection confirms that the model catches both the
  horizontal and vertical root density variation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

With partial root zone drying (PRD) irrigation, the transpiration will
depend on the spatial distribution of the roots, due to the reliance
of root signals.  Several models incorporating this exists,
e.g.\@~\cite{vrugt2001calibration} proposes a flexible, empirical
\twod{} root model with a radial geometry, which \cite{apri}
successfully use to model PRD irrigation of a vineyard.  A static
description of the root density based on measurements was used in the
later application.  For perennial plants using a static description of
the root zone during the irrigation season can make sense, but for
annual plants, such as most vegetables, the root zone must be
considered dynamic.  A dynamic root growth model for row crops based
on diffusion theory was proposed in~\cite{acock1996convective}. In
general this model required a numerical solution, but analytical
solutions for special cases were found by~\cite{willigen2002two}.

The \twod{} radial and the \threed{} root density models typically
include only a single plant.  In contrast, \oned{} models by their
nature will be concerned with a whole population, like a forest or an
agricultural crop.  An example of the later would be the model found
by~\cite{gp74} based on a meta-analysis, where they found an
exponential decrease with depth to match the observations.  The root
models mentioned above are parametric, the root are described as a
density function, where the parameters are position in space relative
to the plant and soil surface.  In contrast architectural root models
track the structure and branches of the roots.  See
\cite{wang2004modelling} for an overview of existing \oned{}, \twod{},
and \threed{} root models, both parametric and architectural.

For looking at the root zone of a single plant, radial coordinates are
a good match.  But when the root zones of the plants overlap, the
problem becomes \threed{}.  Solving Richards equation in \threed{} is
complex and results in long simulation times.  Finding a \twod{}
approximation is therefore desirable.  In this paper we therefore
propose a simple \twod{} model with Euclidean coordinates for row
crops, based on on an extension of \cite{gp74}.  The assumption is
that the row is sufficiently dense in the direction of the rows so we
can ignore that dimension.  The two dimensions then become depth and
horizontal distance from the row.  The proposed model static in that
it doesn't include root growth, but it can be parametrized dynamically
based on root mass and the depth and width of the root zone.

The new root model was used in the SAFIR (SAFe IRrigation) EU project
\citep{safir2010,ssoc} as part of the Daisy agro-ecological model
\citep{daisy-fertilizer,daisy-ems}.  The SAFIR project had two
aspects, the first being assessment of the risk for human health with
regard to use of waster water for irrigation
\citep{Forslund2010440,Surdyk2010451}, and the second water saving
irrigation techniques, in particular PRD \citep{Jensen2010403}.  There
were five experimental sites, three in Europe, and two in China, and
three crops, potatoes, fresh tomatoes, and processing tomatoes.  For
the two Chinese sites root density was measured. The original Daisy
soil water model was extended from \oned{} to \twod{} \citep{1dvs2d},
and used for modelling the experiments.  The original Daisy crop model
\citep{eupotato} calculates root dry mass and root zone depth, and
assumes a root density distribution following \cite{gp74}.  With the
\twod{} extension root zone radius was added to the crop model, as
well as the root zone density distribution model discussed in this
paper.

\section{Model theory}

Our goal is to describe the two dimensional root density distribution
for row crops in terms of root dry mass, root zone depth, and root
zone width.  These values can be provided by a general crop growth
model (like the one found in Daisy), and furthermore have the
advantage that they all have a physical meaning.  However, first we
will describe a traditional one dimensional root density distribution
in terms of root dry mass and root zone depth.  This will provide a
reference for later comparison.

\subsection{Densely populated fields}
\label{sec:model-1d}

In accordance with \cite{gp74}, the root density distribution $L\,(z)$
for a crop can be described by
\begin{equation}
  L\,(z) = L_0\, e^{-a z}
  \label{eq:g+p}
\end{equation}
where $L_0$ is the root density at the soil surface, $a$ is a
distribution parameter, and $z$ is the depth below soil surface.  We
here assume that the density is uniformly distributed on the
horizontal plane, an assumption that fails with e.g.\ row crops.  The
parameters $a$ and $L_0$ will both vary with time.  For a production
oriented simulation model like Daisy, it can be more convenient to
specify the density in terms of accumulated root dry matter $M_r$ and
total root depth $d_c$ \citep{daisyN}.

We define the root depth at the depth where the root density is at a
specified threshold $L_m$.  By inserting this in \eqref{eq:g+p}, we
get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = L_0\, e^{-a \, d_c}
  \label{eq:root-depth}
\end{equation}
We convert the root mass to root length $l_r$ by assuming the specific
root length $S_r$ is a known constant
\begin{equation}
  l_r = S_r \, M_r
  \label{eq:root-length}
\end{equation}
The total root length is also the integral of the root density over
the profile
\begin{equation}
  l_r = \int_0^{\infty} L\, (z) \: dz 
      = \int_0^{\infty} L_0\, e^{-a z} \, dz 
      = \frac{L_0}{a}
  \label{eq:root-integral}
\end{equation}
By inserting the expression we get for $L_0$ from
\eqref{eq:root-integral} in \eqref{eq:root-depth} we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = l_r \, a \, e^{-a \, d_c}
  \label{eq:a-only}
\end{equation}
If we substitute $W = -a \, d_c$ and isolate the known values on the right
side this gives us
\begin{equation}
   W e^W = - L_m \frac{d_c}{l_r}
  \label{eq:Lambert}
\end{equation}
If the root length is suffiently high the equation will have multiple
solutions, but only the solution for $W\leq-1$ is physically
meaningful.  It can be found using Newton's method and an initial
quess of $-2$.  After finding a value for $W$, we can find the desired
density parameters $L_0$ and $a$ by substituting back
\begin{eqnarray}
   a   &=& -W / d_c\\\label{eq:a-solved}
   L_0 &=& \frac{L_m}{e^{-a \, d_c}} = L_m e^{a \, d_c}\label{eq:L0-found}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Limited growth}
\label{sec:soillim}

The distribution in \eqref{eq:g+p} implies a gradual decrease of roots
going towards but never reaching zero.  For some soils this doesn't
match what we observe, rather than a gradual decrease, there is sharp
decrease at a specific depth, as the roots are unable to penetrate
further down.  To handle this, we divide the root depth into a crop
specific and soil independent potential root depth $d_c$, and soil
specific and crop independent maximum root depth $d_s$.  The actual
root depth $d_a$ is then the shallowest of these two.
\begin{equation}
  d_a = \min (d_c, d_s)
  \label{eq:actual-depth}
\end{equation}

We now create a modified root density function $L^\prime (z)$ by
defining it to zero below $d_a$, and scaled to preserve mass balance
above.
\begin{equation}
  L^\prime (z) =
  \begin{cases}
    k^\prime L\, (z) & \text{for $z \leq d_a$}\\
    0 & \text{for $z > d_a$}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:limited-depth}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  k^\prime = \frac{l_r}{\int_0^{d_a} L\, (z) \, dz}
          = \frac{l_r\; a}{L_0 - L_0  \; e^{-a\; d_a}}
  \label{eq:scale-factor}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Row crops}

We can describe a row crop with a two dimensional model by assuming
that the plants are densely packed in the row.  Our second dimension
$x$ is horizontal, orthogonal to the row.  The root density at a
specific point can be denoted $L\, (x,z)$, and we choose a coordinate
system where $L\, (0,0)$ (or $L_{0,0}$) is the root density in the
top center of the row.  We then define the following root distribution
\begin{equation}
  L\, (x,z) = L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x |x|}
  \label{eq:Lxz}
\end{equation}
where $a_z$ and $a_x$ control the density decrease in the two
dimensions.

\subsubsection{Finding the parameters}

To find the parameters $a_z$, $a_x$ and $L_{0,0}$, we assume as before
that the root depth and root mass are known, and now additionally that
the root zone radius at soil surface $w_c$ is known.  We define the
root zone depth $d_c$ to be the depth right below the row ($x = 0$)
where the root density is $L_m$.  As $x=0$ is the place where
\eqref{eq:Lxz} predicts the highest density, the average root density
at that depth will be below $L_m$.  Similarly, we define the radius
$w_c$ as the horizontal distance from the row where the root density
at the surface ($z = 0$) is equal to $L_m$.
\begin{equation}
  L_m = L\, (0,d_c) = L\,(w_c,0)
  \label{eq:minroot}
\end{equation}
See figure~\ref{fig:row} for an illustration.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \hspace{-14mm}\input{row}
  \caption{The \twod{} root zone of a single row of crops.  
    %%The x-axis
    %%denotes horizontal distance to the row, and the z-axis depth below
    %%ground level.  
    The highest root density ($L_{0,0}$) can be found
    in the row at ground level.  The root density decreases
    exponentially, with both horizontal and vertical distance.  Four
    root density isolines are shown.  The three innermost isolines
    each represents a fixed decrease in root density.  The last
    isoline represents the threshold value, $L_m$, and defines both
    the root zone depth ($d_c$) and the root zone radius ($w_c$).}
  \label{fig:row}
\end{figure}

The total root length on one side of the row ($l_R$), which we assume
is known from our crop model, is the integral of the root density over
the half plane
\begin{equation}
    l_R = \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} L\, (x,z) \: dz \, dx = \frac{L_{0,0}}{a_z a_x}
%%        = \int_0^{\infty} \int_0^{\infty} L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x |x|} \: dz \, dx
  \label{eq:root-integral2}
\end{equation}
Thus \eqref{eq:Lxz} can be rewritten 
\begin{equation}
  L\, (x,z) = l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x |x|}  
  \label{eq:axz}
\end{equation}
By using \eqref{eq:axz} in \eqref{eq:minroot} we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  L_m &=& l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_z d_c} \\\label{eq:Ld0}
  L_m &=& l_R\, a_z\, a_x \, e^{-a_x w_c}\label{eq:L0r}
\end{eqnarray}
Thus $e^{-a_z d_c} = e^{-a_x w_c}$ or
\begin{equation}
  a_x = \frac{d_c}{w_c} a_z
  \label{eq:aztoax}
\end{equation}
By inserting \eqref{eq:aztoax} in \eqref{eq:Ld0} we get
\begin{equation}
  L_m = l_R\, a_z\, \frac{d_c}{w_c} a_z \, e^{-a_z d_c}
  \label{eq:azeq1}
\end{equation}
If we substitute 
\begin{equation}
  Q = -a_z d_c
  \label{eq:Qaz}
\end{equation}
and isolate the known values on the right side, this gives us:
\begin{equation}
  Q^2\, e^Q = L_m \frac{d_c \, w_c}{l_R}
  \label{eq:logsquare}
\end{equation}
The equation can have multiple solutions, but only the solution for
$Q\leq -2$ is physically meaningful.  It can be found using Newton's
method with an initial guess of $-3$. Knowing $Q$ we can find
$a_z$~\eqref{eq:Qaz}, $a_x$~\eqref{eq:aztoax}, and
$L_{0,0}$~\eqref{eq:root-integral2}.

\subsubsection{Multiple rows}
\label{sec:model-rows}

If the rows are close, the root systems will overlap as shown on
figure~\ref{fig:zigzag}. In theory, all the rows on the field will
contribute some roots to the interval.  The root density in the
interval will be the sum of all the individual contributions.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \hspace{-6mm}\input{rootdens_L}
  \caption{The x-axis represents the distance from a specific row to
    the midpoint between it and the row to its right.  The L-axis is
    the root density for roots originating in a specific row.  The
    roots from three rows (the row itself and the rows at each side)
    is shown.}
  \label{fig:zigzag}
\end{figure}

If $D$ is the distance between rows, and we assume an infinite number
of identical rows, this can be expressed by the equation
\begin{equation}
  L^* (x,z) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (L\, (x + i D,z) + L\, (D + i D - x,z))\\
  \label{eq:Lxzstar}
\end{equation}
where $L\, (x + 0 D,z)$ represents the contribution from the row
itself,\linebreak{} $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} L\, (x + i D,z)$ represents
the contributions from all the rows to the left, and
$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} L\, (D + i D - x,z)$ represents the contributions
from all the rows to the right.  Equation~\eqref{eq:Lxzstar} is valid
for the half row $0 \leq x \leq D/2$, but can be extended outside the
interval by assuming all rows are identical $L^* (x,z) = L^* (x+D,z)$
and symetrical $L^* (x,z) = L^* (-x,z)$. We can rewrite
\eqref{eq:Lxzstar} to get rid of the sum
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rl}
     & \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (L\, (x + i D,z) + L\, (D + i D - x,z))\\
%%    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} 
%%       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (e^{-a_x (x + i D)} + e^{-a_x (D + i D - x)})\\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (       e^{-a_x x} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i D} 
                          + e^{-a_x (D - x)} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i D})\\
%%    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (D - x)})
%%       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x i D}) \\
    =& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (D - x)})
       \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} ((\frac{1}{e})^{a_x D})^i\\
    =& \frac{L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} (e^{-a_x x} + e^{-a_x (D - x)})}
            {1 - \frac{1}{e}^{a_x D}}\\
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:Lxzstar-solved}
\end{equation}
Two examples of the resulting root density distribution can be found
on figure~\ref{fig:tworows}.

\subsubsection{Mapping between the models}
\label{sec:mapping}

We can get the vertical density distribution for \eqref{eq:Lxzstar} at
a specific depth $L^* (z)$ by finding the total root length density of
a single row \eqref{eq:Lxz} at the specific depth, and divide with the
distance between rows.
\begin{equation}
  L^*(z) = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} L\, (x,z)\, dx}{D}
  \label{eq:x-integrated}
\end{equation}
By setting $L^* (z) = L\, (z)$ and inserting \eqref{eq:Lxz} and
\eqref{eq:g+p} in \eqref{eq:x-integrated} we get
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    L_0\, e^{-a z} &=& \frac{1}{D} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} e^{-a_x |x|} dx\\
                 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z}}{D} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-a_x x} dx\\
                 &=& L_{0,0}\, e^{-a_z z} \frac{0 - 1}{-a_x}\\
                 &=& \frac{2 L_{0,0}}{D a_x} e^{-a_z z}\\
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:1d2d}
\end{equation}
hence $a = a_z$ and $L_0 = \frac{2 L_{0,0}}{a_x D}$ are the parameter
values to use in \eqref{eq:g+p} to get the same vertical density
distribution as \eqref{eq:Lxzstar}.

\section{Data description and methodology}

Root sampling were performed at two experimental fields, the first
being operated by the Chinese Academy for Agricultural Sciences (CAAS)
and located near Zhengzhou in the Henan province, and the second
operated by the Chinese Agricultural University and located near
Beijing.  Potatoes were grown at the CAAS site, while the CAU site
were growing tomatoes.

\subsection{Treatments}

The SAFIR project had two main aspects, the first was the reuse of
waste water for irrigation, with emphasis on human safety.  All
treatments were fertilized, so the constituents of the waste water
would be unlikely to affect crop growth.  Hence, for crop growth the
different irrigation sources could be seen as replicates.  The second
aspect was how the design of the irrigation system could save water.
Two irrigation methods and three irrigation strategies were
considered.  The irrigation methods were subsurface drip irrigation
and furrow irrigation.  The irrigation strategies were full
irrigation, deficit irrigation (70\% of full irrigation), and partial
rootzone drying (like deficit, but application on alternating sides of
the crop).

At the CAAS site, root density sampling was performed in 2006 and
2008.  Unfortunately, the 2006 harvest failed, so we have discarded
that data set.  All treatments were done with three replicates, but
due to the labour intensive nature of root density sampling, that was
only performed on selected plots as outlined in
table~\ref{tab:caas2008treatments} and~\ref{tab:cautreatments}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{CAAS 2008 treatments with root density measurements.

    also used a sand filter (SF), addition plus removal of heavy

\subsection{Root sampling}

Both sites used ridge systems.  To describe it, we use a coordinate
system with the x-axis orthogonal to the ridges with $x$ = 0 cm
representing the top of the ridge, the y-axis along the ridges with
$y$ = 0 cm representing the plant position, and the z-axis
representing depth below the undisturbed ground level.  At the CAAS
site, roots were sampled in a $3\times2\times7$ grid.  The sampling
along the x-axis corresponded to the top of the ridge, the middle of
the ridge wall, and the bottom of the valley ($x$ = 0 cm, $x$ = 18.75
cm, $x$ = 37.5 cm).  The sampling along the y-axis corresponded to the
plant location, and the middle between two plants ($y$ = 0 cm, $y$ =
15 cm).  At the z-axis, there were sampling in ten cm intervals
starting just below the undisturbed ground level ($z$ = 5 cm) at the
top of the ridge, and starting 10 and 20 cm lower for sampling at the
middle and bottom of the ridge system.  The sampling points are
illustrated on figure~\ref{fig:sample-caas}.  A the CAU site, the
sampling were done in a cross shape, with five sample locations at the
top of the ridge ($x$ = 0 cm; and $y$ = -20 cm, $y$ = -10 cm, $y$ = 0
cm, $y$ = 10 cm, $y$ = 20 cm), and five sample locations across the
ridge system ($y$ = 0 cm; and $x$ = -30 cm, $x$ = -15 cm, $x$ = 15 cm,
$x$ = 0 cm, $x$ = 30 cm).  The sampling along the top of the ridge
started at $z$ = -15 cm, that is above undisturbed ground level.  The
sampling across the ridge started at $z$ = 5 cm.  The samplings were
performed in 10 cm intervals, the lowest varied between plots and with
the horizontal distance to the plant, the lowest were at $z$ = 55
cm. See figure~\ref{fig:sample-cau}.

\end{figure}

The CAAS root sampling was performed 2008-06-10, 16 days before
harvest.  The CAU root samplings were performed 2007-05-09 (before
flowering), 2007-07-05 (after flowering), 2008-06-15 (middle of
flowering), and 2008-07-24 (second harvest).

\subsection{Fitting the data to the model}

The root density model presented in this paper assumes flat soil.  To
solve this, a virtual soil surface corresponding to the undisturbed
ground level ($z$ = 0 cm) was used in the model.  Furthermore, the root
density model is \twod{}, while the root data for both sites is
\threed{}.  The root model describes the x-axis (position between row)
and the z-axis (height above ground), but not the y-axis (position
within row).  For the CAAS dataset, we have similar datasets for two
$y$-values, and we have included both datasets, thus fitting a \twod{}
model to a \threed{} dataset.  From the point of view of the model, we
have two observations for each ($x$, $z$) pair.  For the CAU dataset, all
the observations where $y\neq$ 0 cm have $x$ = 0 cm.  Including these would
give an unbalanced dataset.  So for the CAU dataset we have only used
the measurements where $y$ = 0 cm.  Furthermore, we have ignored the
measurements with $z <$ 0 cm, as illustrated on
figure~\ref{fig:sample-cau}.  For each year, we have dataset for each
plot, plus on additional dataset consisting of all measurements from
the same site, in effect a dataset where we considered the different
treatments as replicates.

We used fixed values for the minimal root density ($L_m = 0.1$
cm/cm$^3$) and specific root length ($S_r = 100$ m/g).  The distance
between rows ($D$) were taken from the experimental setup, 75 cm for
CAAS and 80 cm for CAU.  Given these, we could create a function that
calculated the coefficient of determination (R$^2$) for the \oned{}
model based on root dry mass ($M_r$) and root zone depth ($d_c$) as
described in section~\ref{sec:model-1d}.  Imposing a soil limit (see
section~\ref{sec:soillim}) did not improve the fit, so we used $d_a =
d_c$.  For the \twod{} model, we created a similar function based on
section~\ref{sec:model-rows} that in addition took the horizontal root
zone radius ($w_c$) as a parameter.  For each dataset, we found the
parameter values that gave the highest R$^2$ using
the~\cite{nelder1965simplex} simplex algorithm.

The \oned{} model has two free variables ($M_r$ and $d_c$) as used
above, while the \twod{} model has three free variables ($M_r$, $d_c$,
and $w_c$).  Furthermore, as demonstrated in
section~\ref{sec:mapping}, the \oned{} model is special case of the
\twod{} model.  This means we can use an F-test on the hypothesis that
the \twod{} provide no significant advantage over the \oned{} model.
We used $p=0.05$ as the test criteria.

\section{Results}

For the CAAS site, the fully irrigated treatments all had yield
between 22 and 23 Mg/ha, while the deficit and PRD treatments had
yields from 18 to 21 Mg/ha, with the exception of plot 21 where the
yield was 14 Mg/ha.  For comparison, FAOSTAT reports Chinese national
average for 2008 as 15 Mg/ha.  For the CAU site, yield were between 42
and 52 Mg/ha (Chinese average 23 Mg/ha).  There were no clear link
between yield and treatment. See~\citep{Jensen2010403} for further
discussion.

Table~\ref{tab:ftest} shows the best fit root parameters for the
\twod{} root density model, as well as the coefficient of
determination (R$^2$) for both the \twod{} and \oned{} models, and the
F-test value.  The horizontal root zone radius is the parameter that
shows the largest variation between treatments, and root zone depth is
the parameter that shows least variation.  With the exception of the
early 2008 sampling of CAU plot 12, the \twod{} R$^2$ is always above
0.55, with a median of 0.86.  The potato (CAAS) tend to have a wider
root zone and more root mass than the tomato (CAU), but no clear
difference in root zone depth.  The \oned{} R$^2$ were much lower
(less than 0.20) for the plots where the estimated \twod{} root zone
radius was less than half the distance between rows.  The F-test
showed that the \twod{} model gave a significant better fit than the
\oned{} model for all the aggregate datasets, half the CAAS datasets,
and all but but three of the CAU datasets.

The aggregate datasets have an R$^2$ for the \twod{} model are lower
than for the individual datasets, except for the two 2008 CAU
samplings.  We see on figure~\ref{fig:caas2008}, \ref{fig:cau2007},
and~\ref{fig:cau2008} that the CAU 2008 aggregate datasets also have
the lowest standard deviation between plots.  The CAAS 2008 aggregate
dataset has the highest standard deviation, reflecting the fact that
half the model parameter fits show a wide root zone, and the other
half a narrow root zone.  Both plots using subsoil drip irrigation and
partial rootzone drying for the CAAS site show a wide root zone, and
both plots with subsoil drip and ``normal'' deficit irrigation show a
relatively narrow root zone.  However, one of the fully irrigated
subsoil plots has a wide root zone, and the other a narrow root zone.
The three samplings at the CAU site that shows a wide root zone
represent both irrigation methods and both irrigation strategies.  The
two 2008 sampling at CAU shows a tendency of the roots to concentrate
near the center of the row, as illustrated on
figure~\ref{fig:tworows}.  The tendency is partly supported by the
2007 data, where the root zone sampling was performed earlier.

\section{Discussion and concluding remarks}

A major source of uncertainty is the mapping of the 3D ridge geometry
to a 2D flat surface.  For both sites, we ignore the root mass that
are placed in the top of the ridge.  We also ignore that the ridge
valley does not contain any soil.  For the CAU site we furthermore
ignore the third dimension, using only measurements at y = 0 cm where
the root density is highest.  These systematic errors affect the
estimate of all three parameters, but especially the root dry mass.
However, a comparison between plots at the same site should still be
valid.

The statistical analysis (table~\ref{tab:ftest}) shows us that the
presented \twod{} model constitutes a significant improvement over the
\oned{} model, especially in the cases where the root zone from the
individual row is narrow.  Furthermore, visual inspection of observed
data vs.\@ predicted data
(figure~\ref{fig:caas2008},~\ref{fig:cau2007}, and~\ref{fig:cau2008})
shows that the model provides a good match for both the horizontal and
vertical variation in root density.  Based on this we believe that the
model will be useful for the intended purpose of simulating soil water
dynamics in row crops.

Additionally, we believe that conversion of root density measurements
to general crop parameters (root dry mass, root zone depth, and root
zone radius) will be useful when analysing the effect of treatments,
climate, or soil type on root development.  Such an analysis is
outside the scope of this paper, but the numbers presented on
table~\ref{tab:ftest} do not give a clear indication of the difference
in treatments being the main factor in the difference between plots
for the present experiment.

\section{Software and data availability}

Software to estimate root mass and root zone depth from \oned{} root
density data, and in addition root zone radius from \twod{} root
density data, can be found at \url{http://www.daisy-model.org/} (look
under \texttt{Wiki}, \texttt{\textsc{gp2d}}).  Also supported is
estimating root density distribution from root mass, root zone depth,
and optionally, root zone radius.  The program code is written in
\cplusplus{} and is covered by on open source license (\textsc{gnu
  lgpl}), so it can be freely incorporated in other models.

The root density data from the two field sites will be made available
at \url{http://www.safir4eu.org/} from MNA-TODO-XXXX-DATE
(look under \texttt{Trials}).

\subsection*{Introduction}

\begin{em}
  Too much about PRD.
\end{em}

Partial root zone drying (PRD) is an irrigation technique where
irrigation is applied on only part of the root zone, dividing it into
a wet and a dry zone.  The idea is then that root signals from the dry
zone will lower the hydraulic conductivity through of the stomata, and
thus reduce the transpiration from the wet zone.  Used properly, the
technique has been shown to provide significant water savings
(MNA-TODO: REF).  For PRD to work, the irrigation scheme must
alternate between what part of the root zone is wet, and what part is
kept dry. (MNA-TODO: REF-SAFIR/Fulai) recommends that (MNA-TODO:
SAFIR/Fulai strategy).  When these conditions are fulfilled is
determined by both the movement of water through the soil matrix from
the wet zone to the dry zone, and by the water uptake through the
plant roots.  The established solution to the first is based on
Richards equation \citep{richardseq}.  The formulation must be at
least \twod{} to include both the vertical and a horizontal component.

The issue of water uptake from the soil matrix through the roots can
be broken into the total uptake (approximately equal to the
transpiration), and the spatial distribution within the root zone.

\subsection*{Model theory}

\begin{em}
  The W and Q equations aren't that complex, their solutions doesn't
  warrent as much text and figures.
\end{em}

\subsubsection*{Numeric solution to $W$}

The expression on the left hand side of the equation is depicted on
figure~\ref{fig:W}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_W}
  \caption{The Lambert-W expression ($W e^W$).}
  \label{fig:W}
\end{figure}

The solution to this equation with regard to
$W$ happens to be the definition of the Lambert-W function
\citep{lambert58,euler83}.

In order to solve \eqref{eq:Lambert} with regard to $W$, we first
divide the expression into monotonic intervals by finding the
derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \, (W e^W)}{dW} = e^W + W e^W
  \label{eq:derived-W}
\end{equation}
The equation
\begin{equation}
  e^W + W e^W = 0
  \label{eq:derived-W-solutions}
\end{equation}
has one solution, $W=-1$. The expression $W\, e^W$ is decreasing below
$-1$ and increasing above $-1$.  Thus, a global minimum is obtained
for $W=-1$.

Since $\lim_{W\to-\infty} W\,e^W=0$ we get a single solution
to~\eqref{eq:Lambert} when $-L_m \frac{d_c}{l_r}$ is exactly at the
bottom point ($-1 e^{-1}$), two when it is above (it is never
positive), and none when it is below.  The later situation corresponds
to the case where there is insufficient root $l_r$ to satisfy the
minimal root density $L_m$ within the given root zone $d_c$.

Both solutions are valid, but represent different distributions.
\begin{itemize} 
\item The solution for $W < -1$ represents a large $a$ parameter. From
  \eqref{eq:L0-found} we see this also means $L_0$ is large.  Thus,
  the solution corresponds to a root zone with a high density near the
  top that decreases rapidly to $L_m$ at the bottom of the root zone,
  and continues to decrease so only a small contribution to the total
  root length come from below the root zone.
\item The solution for $W > -1$ (and thus small values of $a$ and
  $L_0$) corresponds to a low root density near the top that
  decreases slowly, and thus gives a larger contribution to the total
  root length from below the root zone.
\end{itemize}
As the total root length increases, pressing $W$ towards $0$ or
$-\infty$, the difference between the solutions grow.  When there is
just enough roots to satisfy the constraints at $W = -1$, the two
solutions converges to one.  As we like our roots to stay mostly
within the root zone, we choose the solution for $W < -1$.  We can
thus find $W$ numerically using Newton's method and an initial guess
of $-2$.

\subsubsection*{Numeric solution to $Q$}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \input{rootdens_Q}
  \caption{The Q expression ($Q^2 e^Q$).}
  \label{fig:Q}
\end{figure}

We know $Q^2\, e^Q$ and want to find $Q$.  We start by dividing the
expression into monotonic intervals by finding the derivative
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d (Q^2\, e^Q)}{dQ} = 2 Q e^Q + Q^2 e^Q
  \label{eq:derived}
\end{equation}
The equation
\begin{equation}
  2 Q e^Q + Q^2 e^Q = 0
  \label{eq:derived-solutions}
\end{equation}
has two solutions, $Q=0$ and $Q=-2$, and the expression $Q^2\, e^Q$ is
increasing below $-2$, decreasing between $-2$ and $0$, and increasing
above $0$. Thus, $Q=0$ is a local (and in this case also global)
minimum, and $Q=-2$ is a local maximum.

We are not interested in positive values for $Q$, they correspond to
negative values for $a_z$, the simplification in
\eqref{eq:root-integral2} are only valid if $a_z > 0$. Since
$\lim_{Q\to-\infty} Q^2\,e^Q=0$ we get a single negative solution when
$L_m \frac{d_c \, w_c}{l_R}$ is exactly at the top point ($2^2 e^{-2}$),
two when it is smaller (it is never negative), and none when it is
larger.  

Both negative solutions are valid, but represent different
distributions.  The solution for $Q > -2$ corresponds to a root
distribution with a large fraction of the root length being located
from outside the root zone, hence we choose the solution for $Q < -2$.
We can find $Q$ numerically using Newton's method and an initial guess
of $-3$.

the 2008 sampling were later than the 2007 sampling at the CAU site.
