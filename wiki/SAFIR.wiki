SAFIR is an [EU] project to help provide _saf_e _ir_rigation.  

The two main components of this project is 
  # health issues related to use of low quality water for irrigation.
  # use of [PRD partial rootzone drying] (PRD) for conserving water.

Some Daisy related tasks include:

  # Support for row crops, including a [GP2D 2D root density] model.
  # Two dimensional soil description.
  # One or more tomato parameterization
  # A [SVAT Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transpher] (SVAT) model.
  # Much more.
