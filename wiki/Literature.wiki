#summary Daisy literature and bibliography.
#labels Subject-Paper

We have collected references to Daisy related papers in two notes.

[http://daisy-model.googlecode.com/files/LitChronoV1.pdf Chronological Daisy bibliography divided by type, subject area, and project.]

[http://daisy-model.googlecode.com/files/LitAlphaV1.pdf Alphabetical list of Daisy publications, plus list of papers describing independent models reimplemented in Daisy.]

Both are incomplete, please send any additions and suggestions to us.  In general, we want to list papers that either describe Daisy, or an application of Daisy.
