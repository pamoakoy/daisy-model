#summary Colloid generation and filtration
#labels Subject-Daisy

Colloids in Daisy is simulated using the chemistry framework, with two pseudo-chemicals, representing colloids in the solute, and colloids being filtered, and two pseudo-reactions, generation of colloids and filtration of colloids.  

Both reaction models are implemented and parameterized according to _Modelling particle mobilization and leaching in macroporous soil_, by Jarvis et.al, 1999.

To include colloids in Daisy, add `colloids` to the `Chemistry` parameter in the `default` column model.

The `colloid` chemistry model is defined in the `chemisty.dai` library file.  The two pseudo-chemicals are named `colloid` and `colloid-filtered`, and are defined in the same file. The `colloid-filtered` pseudo-chemical is inert, and only included to track where the colloids end up.  The two reactions are named `filter` (for filtration) and `MACRO` for generation.  The reference manual will contain description of their parameters.

The generic log parameterizations `Field chemical`, `Soil Chemical` and `Chemical Content` are useful for keeping track of the two pseudo-chemicals.  The specialized `Colloids` log parameterization will give additional information about the generation of colloids.

The file `test-colloids.dai` in the `sample` directory contains a sample setup file with colloids.
