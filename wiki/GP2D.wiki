Daisy includes a 2D root density model for row crops, based on Gerwitz and Page.

We have a [GP2Dsheet standalone excel sheet] for fitting the model to your data.

...

Here should be information about

  * The physical/mathematical model.
  * The Daisy `rootdens` model named `GP2D`.
  * The Daisy `program` model named `GP2D`.
  * The paper written on the model.

Maybe also an honorable mention to the [SAFIR] project that financed it, and where the model is documented.
