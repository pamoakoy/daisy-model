#summary Daisy 4.01 is the latest stable version.
#labels Subject-Release

Daisy is currently undergoing a lot of changes, the most significant being support for 2D geometries.  The latest version before these changes may therefore be preferred for stability reasons.

You can [http://daisy-model.googlecode.com/files/Daisy%204.01.zip fetch version 4.01 here].

Note that the MS Windows installer was not written back then, so you have to unpack the archive yourself.  Version 4.01 of "sample" and "lib" directories are also included, as well as version 4.00 of the reference manual and tutorial.

In general we recommend that people who work closely with us get the latest version which we can provide the best support for, while people who work more independently should stick with the stable version.
