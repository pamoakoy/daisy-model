= Building Daisy =

Daisy is build with GNU Make, and requires a Unix-like environment, such as GNU/Linux or Cygwin.  Cygwin is what is used for development, so GNU/Linux compilation may fail.

The main target for building the command line executable is
{{{
  make daisy.exe
}}}
on MS Windows, or
{{{
  make daisy
}}}
on GNU/Linux.

The GUI is build with
{{{
  make daisyw.exe
}}}
on MS Windows.  There are not yet any rules for building it under GNU/Linux.

The compiler used for development is GNU GCC.  From time to time Daisy is ported to other compilers (Visual C++, C++Builder, and Intel ICC) but these tend to break again very soon.   We do use other building environments at all.

The C# interface has only been compiled with Microsoft `csc.exe` under Cygwin.

The GUI libraries used is Qt, only the free MinGW version for have been tested.

The boost libraries is used and must always be available, allthough only `boost::noncopyable` is used outside the 2D code.  The 2D code also use `boost::ublas`, and Tim Davis' [http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/CXSparse/ CXSparse generic sparse matrix library].

= Accessing Daisy = 

Here will eventually be information about accessing Daisy from other programs through C++, C, C#, .net, and OpenMI.

= Changing the Daisy source code =

Here will be information about changing the Daisy source code.  

Currently, we have information about the code that implements the [CodeTertiary tertiary] [SoilDomains soil domain]. 

In general, we mostly follow the [http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html GNU Coding Standards].
