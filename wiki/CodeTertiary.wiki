= Introduction =

This page describes the code for implementing tertiary transport in Daisy.  Tertiary transport here is the transport of water and solutes in "large" macropores, as described in the [SoilDomains soil domains] page.  The "large" macropores are macropores where the capillary forces no longer dominates, typically biopores as made by earthworms or old root channels.  Their diameter are typically in the millimeter range.

== Small and large timesteps ==

There are two different interfaces for tertiary transport, one for water transport alone in the small timesteps inside the solution of Richard's equation, and one for both water and solute transport in the large timesteps outside of the matrix water transport solution.  Solute transport always happens in the large timesteps, and water transport should only happen in one of the two, despite there being two interfaces.

Note that "small and large timesteps" doesn't actually refer to the absolute size of the timesteps, but to the fact that the model has a base timestep, which we call the large timestep, and that some processes, in this case the solutions to Richard's equation, may have to divide the large timestep into smaller units, called small timesteps.

In fact, to get solute transport right it will often be necessary to reduce the large timestep when the tertiary domain first gets activated, typically during heavy rainfall or irrigation.   But this reduction does not guarantee that the solution to Richard's equation won't require further reductions, so the [CodeTertsmall small timestep interface] is still needed. 

= The tertiary component =

The interface to the tertiary component is the `Tertiary` class in [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/source/browse/trunk/tertiary.h tertiary.h].

== The small timestep interface to water ==

To access the small timestep interface, the following function should be called.

{{{
  virtual Tertsmall& implicit () = 0;
}}}

Note that the small timestep interface is only used by some matrix transport models, the rest will ignore it.  Neither need all tertiary models support it, those that don't can simply return {{{Tertsmall::none ()}}}.  

The small timestep interface only handles interaction with matrix water, not infiltration from the surface, which is always handled by the large timestep interface.  Furthermore, if the small timestep interface handles interaction with matrix water, the large timestep interface shouldn't.

You can read more about [CodeTertsmall the small timestep interface].

== The large timestep interface to water ==

{{{
  virtual void tick (const Geometry&, const Soil&, const SoilHeat&,
                     const double dt, SoilWater&, Surface&, Treelog&) = 0;
}}}

This function have two purposes, first it should extract any water from the surface that should go to the biopores, and the second is the interaction with the matrix water if that is not handled by the small timesteps.

== The large timestep interface to solutes ==

{{{
  virtual void solute (const Geometry&, const SoilWater&, 
                       const std::map<size_t, double>& J_tertiary,
                       const double dt,
                       Chemical&, Treelog&) = 0;
}}}

This function will be called once for each chemical that is tracked by Daisy.  The `J_tertiary` parameter contains information about how much of the chemical enter directly to the biopores from the surface.  It is implemented as a map of edge -> flux.  When implementing a model you should iterate over all the map entries, to be sure all the fluxes are added to the biopore domain.

== Other functions == 

{{{
  virtual bool has_macropores () = 0;
}}}

This should return true, unless you are implementing a model with no tertiary transport.  It is used by the heuristics for discretization of the soil.

The {{{check}}}, {{{initialize}}}, and {{{output}}} functions have their usual meanings. 

= Models =

== The none model ==

The none model does nothing, and is implemented by the `TertiaryNone` class in [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/source/browse/trunk/tertiary.C tertiary.C].

== The old model ==

The old model is implemented by the `TertiaryOld` class in [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/source/browse/trunk/tertiary_old.C tertiary_old.C].  It delegates water transport to the macro component, and solute transport the mactrans component.  It only works with the vertical movement component, for which it is default.  It does not support small timesteps.

== The biopores model ==

The biopores model is implemented by the `TertiaryBiopores` class in [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-model/source/browse/trunk/tertiary_biopores.C tertiary_biopores.C].  It implements both the small and large timestep interfaces, using multiple inheritance.  The biopores model divides the tertiary domain into a number of classes, each represented by a biopore model.

It is described in more details in CodeTertiaryBiopores.
