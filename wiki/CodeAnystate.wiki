#summary A generic copyable state.
#labels Subject-Code

The `Anystate` abstraction can be used for storing and restoring the state of a object, without knowing the exact class of the object.

The basic idea is that a base class (the "component") can provide the interface functions

{{{
  virtual Anystate get_state () const = 0;
  virtual void set_state (const Anystate&) = 0;
}}}

for users to get and set the state of the object.  The only thing the user can do with an Anystate` object apart from calling `set_state` is to copy it.

The derived class (the "model") must then implement these functions.
