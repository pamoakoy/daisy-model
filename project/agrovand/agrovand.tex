\chapter{Introduction}

The Rørrendegård site is part of the Copenhagen University
experimental station in Tåstrup.  It was selected for for the present
project mainly because because of the high resolution flow
proportional drain data collected as part of the Agrovand project in
the four drain season between between 1998 and 2002, which included
soil particles, a likely transport path for strongly sorbing
pesticides.  The results of the Agrovand project have been partly
documented in~\citet{petersen200181} (biopores),
\citet{petersen2002movement} (particles and pesticides),
\citet{petersen2004movement} (particles and bromide), and
\citet{petersen2008spatio} (anisotropy).

The main focus of the Agrovand project was the influence of tillage on
the soil as a transport medium, so four plots with different tillage
strategies were followed.  In this project we have only studied the
data from plot 4, representing conventional tillage, and only the
first three season where the best data is availble.  Apart from
particles, the drain water has been analysed for bromide (one
application), pendimethalin (two applications) and ioxynil (one
application), which we have chosen to include in our simulations
simulate.  Soil water have been followed with piezometers,
tensiometers, and TDR probes.  The most stable results are from the
TDR probes, and the only one we have used for our calibration.
Furthermore, transport pathways have been explored using dye tracer,
and biopores have been counted both in the original project, and with
more detail forming the basis for the new Daisy biopore model in the
present project~\citep{habekost1,habekost2,habekost3}.

The goal for the simulations presented in this paper is to test the
two subcomponents of the the newly developed 2D Daisy against real
data: The first is the particle generation and filtration modules; the
second is the slow/fast water movement.  For the later, we will use
the drain bromide data which are available at a high resolution, and
where we have reliable soil measurements to back them up with.  The
pesticide data is presented together with uncalibrated simulation
results as the PLAP sites have more detailed pesticide data
available~\citep{lindhardt2001,vap2009,vap2d}.  The Agrovand data is a
useful suplement though, as we don't have particle data for the PLAP
sites, and the PLAP bromide suffer from the fact that the application
was in spring, meaning an unknown amount have been uptaken by the
crop.  In Agrovand the bromide application was in the autumn,
minimizing the potential plant uptake.

\chapter{Setup}

The Agrovand data has been used from the beginning of the current
project for developing the new model, giving the final setup a rich
history.
\begin{enumerate}
\item An initial setup was developed for water and bromide using the
  original Daisy model by Tilde Hellsten, as part of her Master
  Thesis~\citep{tilde-agrovand}.
\item A setup for water using the new 2D model was developed by Nanna
  Gudmand-Høyer, as part of her Master Thesis~\citep{nanna-agrovand}.
\item This 2D setup was extended for bromide, particles, and
  pesticides by Mikkel Mollerup, and used as a basis for the PLAP site
  calibration~\citep{vap2d}.
\item Based on the model changes and experience gained made during the
  PLAP site calibration, the setup was recalibrated by Per Abrahamsen.
\end{enumerate}

This history does mean that the setup likely contain parameter choices
that no longer are applicable due to changes in the model, and that a
new setup made from scratch could be simpler or give better results,
had time permitted.

\section{Weather}

All weather data with the exception of precipitation were collected at
a station located at Højbakkegård, XXX meter from the experimental
field.  Three sources were considered for precipitation.  Hourly
measurements XXX meter above ground at the field in the drain seasons,
hourly measurements at Højbakkegård XXX meter above ground, and daily
measurements at ground level.

As a starting point, we used the hourly field measurements for the
drain season, supplemented with the hourly measurements from
Højbakkegård for the rest of the season.  These were compared with the
daily measurements.  Where the daily measurements showed precipitan
but the hourly measurements didn't we examined the TDR measurements
near the surface.  If they indicated precipitation, the daily were
used to supplement the hourly measurements.  Comparison of monthly
sums between the hourly and daily precipitation data indicated no
systematic bias, thus the hourly data were used without correction for
possible effect of wind and snowfall.

\section{Management}

All seasons had winter wheat with mineral fertilizer, with one plowing
operation between harvest and sowing.  For Daisy, the dates of the
plowing, sowing and harvest is used (table~\ref{tab:crop-man}).
Furthermore, Daisy use information about the seed bed preperation.  As
we have not enabled nitrogen in the simulation, the fertilization
operations are irrelevant.  We use default parameters for the tillage
operations.  For the harvest, we specify 8 cm stub and that stems and
leaves are left on the field.  However, since we have not enabled a
model for above ground litter, and we are not interested in soil
organic matter, that information is not used in the simulation.

In the 2004 and 2005 seasons, the potential evapotranspiration for a
winter wheat on the experimental field was measured using an eddy
covariance system, and from this a dynamic crop factor was calculated
(\citet{kjaersgaard2008crop}).  The the default parameterization was
adjusted based on this, and furthermore as part of calibration of soil
water the max penetration depth was increased to 1.5 meter, and the
interception coeeficient were lowered to 0.05 mm per LAI.

Date and amount is specified for pesticide and bromide application.
The model setup described in \citet{vap2d} were duplicated here, with
field values for DT50 and \koc{} taken from \citet{ppdb20100517}.  No
calibration was done on the persticides.  See

All management operation are assumed to be performed at noon.

\section{Soil profile}

The soil profile and the description of the drain canyon is based on
the work presented in \citet{habekost3}, where \textsc{isss4} testure
classification was used.  \citet{petersen200181} presents testure and
dry bulk density (\rhob{}) analyses for four depths, which have been
used as basis for the main horizons.  Unfortunately, no measurements
for the C horizon is presented, instead we use the measurement from
the bottom of the B horizon (85--90 cm).  The Ap measurements (10--15
cm) differers between treatments and between spring and autumn, we
have used the spring values for T4 (conventional tillage).  The soil
humus data are from plot A in \citet{petersen2002movement}.  The
values used are summarized in table~\ref{tab:texture}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Soil properties. Depth is specified in cm below soil surface, 
    and the dry bulk density (\rhob{}) specified in g/cm$^3$.
    Humus is given as a percentage of total weight.  For the drain canying, 
    where the \textsc{isss4} texture classification system was used,
    the mineral mineral soil particle distribution is also given as
    fraction of total weight.  For the other horizons the \textsc{usda3} 
    system was used, and the mineral soil particle distribution is given 
    as percentage of total mineral weight.}

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Hydraulic properties of the matrix domain}

\Hypres{} was used initially to estimate hydraulic properties for all
horizons. The TDR measurements (see figure~\ref{fig:tdr}) have been
used for calibrating.  The only parameter that has been changes is
$K_{\mbox{sat}}$ (saturated conductivity).  For the surface layer (top
3 cm), this has been decreased to 10\% of the value suggested by
\hypres{}.  In the Bt horizon conductivity has been decreased to 50\%,
and in the C horizon is has been trippled.  The result is shown on
figure~\ref{fig:Rorrende-hor}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption{R{\o}rrende soil hydraulic properties.  \Hypres{} refers to
    parameters estimated according to \citet{hypres}, Daisy to the
    final parametrization (ignoring anisotropy and biopores), and
    surface and plow pan to the conditions at the top of the A and Bt
    horizons.}
  \label{fig:Rorrende-hor}
\end{figure}

We have not included cracks in the description of the conductivity
curve.  Based on \citet{petersen2008spatio} we chose to add an
anisotropy of 12 (meaning horizontal flow is 12 times faster than
vertical) to the plow pan.

\section{Fast and slow water}

The division between fast and slow water for the Ap horizon were
mainly calibrated from the measurements shown on the top graph on
figure~\ref{fig:bromide-acc}.  The simulated dynamics shown on
figure~\ref{fig:bromide} were used as a help.  The two figures are
explained in section~\ref{sec:soil-bromide}.

\chapter{Results}

The simulation results are presented together with measured data in
figures~\ref{fig:first} to~\ref{fig:last}, found at the end of the
report.  The figures have a high information density, and have
therefore been allowed to fill most of the page.  Each figure contains
multiple graphs, all of which share the same x-axis.  This structure
is intended to facilitate comparison.

and~\label{fig:season0001zoom} focus on a single event within each
drain season.

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Colloid generation}

The most signficant part of the dataset is the colloid leaching for
different soil treatment regimes.  We have only looked at the
conventional tillage regime, and used that for calibrating the colloid
generation model described in \citet{macro-colloid}.  By using data
from the three other regimes, it should be possible to improve the
model to takes into account the timing of tillage operations, and help
predict the possible effect of low tillage regimes on pesticide
leaching.
