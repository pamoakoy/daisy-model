\section{Discussion and conclusion}

It is possible to explain the measured data based on the processes
included in the present model, with some caveats
\begin{itemize}
\item The high degree of heterogenity found in the Estrup site would
  require a detailed 3D model of the entire area to model
  mechanistically, the current 2D model setup must be viewed as
  ``effective parameters''.
\item * Silstrup drain dynamics.  Surface transport both for drain and for bromide.
\item * Large scale fracture transport.
\end{itemize}
This work does not count as a validation of the parameterization or
the conceptual model, there are too many unknowns where we have had to
guess or calibrate parameters, and there are likely many different
setups that would have resultet in as good or better fits to the
measured results.  It is not certain that a proper validation is
possible, but by appling the model on more datasets we should be able
to gain confidence in it it.

Further work:
* Surface processes.
* Pesticide processes (colloids, sorbtion sites, sorption kinetics)
* More sites and years.
