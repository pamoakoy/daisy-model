\chapter{Introduction}

The Danish Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme (PLAP) has been
monitoring drain and soil water since 1999 in six different locations
in order to evaluate the leaching risk of pesticides.  Pesticides are
found in some drain water measurements, but not in the horizontal
filters 3.5 meter below the surface.

In order to better understand the system, and eventually how the
measurements can be better used for assessing potential risk of
contamination of drinking water, the Daisy agricultural model has been
extended with support for those processes we assume are relevant for
transport of pesticides from surface to drain pipes.

To test our understanding as embedded in the model, as well as the
applicability of the model to the PLAP sites, two PLAP sites, four
pesticides, and two years of data have been modelled as a pilot
project.  Our hypothesis is here that we can explain the measured data
with the model.

The most significant measured results are from the Estrup site, so
that was fixed as the first site.  We wanted to use the same years for
both sites to see the results of similar climate on two different
locations.  Hourly weather data from the site had to be present, both
for the modelling period and for one growth season before for warmup.
The initial choice of F{\aa}rdrup for the second site was rejected, as
it was not possible to get sufficient quality weather data.
Furthermore, we wanted the same pesticides on both sites, and both
weakly and strongly sorbing pesticides represented.  Glyphosate had to
be one of them.

Based on these criteria, we chose Silstrup and Estrup, drain seasons
2000-2001 and 2001-2002, with the pesticides glyphosate, fenpropimorph,
dimethoate, and metamitron.

Both sites are described in detail in \citet{lindhardt2001}, with an
overview of the measured data found in \citet{vap2009}.  Estrup is a
pedologically rich site, containing both areas with sand and clay,
peat, thin layers of chalk, and even sand from railroad construction.
Silstrup is also heterogeneous, but less so, with high levels of clay
dominating the area.  Figure 5.13 of \citet{lindhardt2001} is
illustrative, based on two profiles Silstrup shows the second largest
variation, but is consistently the highest or second highest in clay
content among the PLAP sites.  Estrup, on the other hand, show even
larger variation, and features both the highest and lowest clay
content among the four clay sites.

\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Validation}

It is possible to explain the measured data based on the processes
included in the present model, with some caveats
\begin{itemize}
\item The high degree of heterogeneity found in the Estrup site would
  require a detailed 3D model of the entire area to model
  mechanistically, the current 2D model setup can at best be viewed as
  ``effective parameters''.
\item The simulated second year drain season for Silstrup is too
  short. This is particularly noticeable for the Bromide measurements.
\item Measurements at both sites show
  (figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-weekly2} and~\ref{fig:Estrup-weekly}) that
  the initial glyphosate event is followed by a couple of weeks of
  addition drain leaching.  We believe this is due to easily
  remobilizable glyphosate in the preferential transport system, a
  process we have not implemented in our model.
\item Bromide is found in some of the horizontal filters at 3.5 meters
  depth at both sites in the first measurements after application of
  Bromide.  No pesticides are found in those depth though.  It does
  indicate a transport way for non-sorbing solutes that we cannot
  model.  One possibility is large scale fractures, this suggestion is
  supported by other work at GEUS.
\end{itemize}

Sine we have been developing the model (adding new processes), the
work presented in this report cannot count as a validation.

\section{Deep leaching of pesticides}

Figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-leak150} and~\ref{fig:Estrup-leak150} show
some deep leaching of pesticides in Silstrup, but apart from a single
event, none for Estrup.  If we look at
figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-C-Metamitron-2000},~\ref{fig:Silstrup-C-Glyphosate-2001},
and~\ref{fig:Estrup-C-Glyphosate-2000} we see the metamitron moving
downward but being diluted in the process.  The glyphosate is not
visible moving from beyond the end of the biopores at either site.
The high concentration at the end the biopores is likely mostly a
reflection of a limitation in the model, we have specified all
biopores to end in the same depth, in reality they will end at
different depths.

\section{Process understanding}

Apart from the significance of biopores for pesticide leaching, it is
interesting to note how the two sites are dominated by different
processes.  For Silstrup surface processes (crust formation, litter,
and overland flow) were dominating the system.  For Estrup, the
measurements can to a large degree be adequately explained by what
happens in the plowing layer, see e.g.\ the first year horizontal
bromide flux (figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-Bromide-2000-horizontal}).

\section{Further work}

Apart from applying the model on more and larger data sets, two areas
in particular need further work.
\begin{itemize}
\item The surface processes (flow, litter storage, decomposition) are
  very important, especially for the Silstrup site, but only the
  minimal work on those to get an effect have been done in this project.
\item The pesticide processes (colloid transport, sorption sites,
  sorption kinetics, and decomposition) are parametrized from
  literature values and ``best guesses'', many of those parameters
  should be adapted to direct local measurements.
\end{itemize}
