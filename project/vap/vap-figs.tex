* Silstrup drain period may be too short due to heterogenity.

* Silstrup drain flow follow first rain, indicate surface flow and anisotropy

\section{Conclusion and further work}

It is possible to explain the measured data based on the processes
included in the present model, with some caveats
\begin{itemize}
\item The high degree of heterogenity found in the Estrup site would
  require a detailed 3D model of the entire area to model
  mechanistically, the current 2D model setup can at best be viewed as
  ``effective parameters''.
\item The drain are activated more abrubtly (first year) and sooner
  (second year) in reality, than what we have been able to simulate
  for the Silsrup site.  This is particularily noticable for the
  Bromide measurements.  
\item Bromide is found in some of the horizontal filters at 3.5 meters
  depth at both sites in the first measurements after application of
  Bromide.  No pesticides are found in those depth though.  It does
  indicate a transport way for non-sorbing solutes that we cannot
  model.  One possibility is large scale fractures, this suggestion is
  supported by other work at GEUS.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the work presented in thus report cannot count as a
validation of either the parameterization or the conceptual model,
there are too many unknowns where we have had to guess or calibrate
parameters, and there are likely many different setups that would have
resultet in as good or better fits to the measured results.  It is not
certain that a proper validation is possible, but by applying the
model on more datasets we should be able to gain confidence in it it.

Apart from applying the model on more and larger datasets, two areas
in particular need further work.
\begin{itemize}
\item The surface processes (flow, litter storage, decomposition) are
  very important, especially for the Silstrup site, but only the
  minimal work on those to get an effect have been done in this project.
\item The pesticide processes (colloid transport, sorbtion sites,
  sorption kinetics, and docposition) are parameterized from
  litterature values and ``best guesses'', many of those parameters
  should be adabted to direct local measurements.
\end{itemize}
