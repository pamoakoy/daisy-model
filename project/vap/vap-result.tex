\chapter{Results}

In this chapter, dynamic measurements are compared to simulated
results.  We have chosen to present all the measured soil and drain
data we received, even those that for some reason or another have not
been considered in the calibration process.  Data regarding dynamic
crop growth is not presented.  Static data used for the initial setup
(soil physics) and dynamic data used to drive the simulation (weather,
groundwater pressure, and crop management) are presented in
chapter~\ref{cha:setup}.  Daisy will calculate a lot of other
information, which is useless for validation purposes, but can be
important for interpretation of the results.  We have chosen to put
what we consider the most important such data (regarding colloids,
biopores and 2D flow) in
appendix~\ref{app:col-biopores},~\ref{app:silstrup-2d}
and~\ref{app:estrup-2d}.  The data presented in this chapter fall in
two broad categories: measurements of water and solutes within the
soil, and measurements of water and solutes in the drains.  The
measurement points referred to throughout this chapter can be found in
\citet{vap2009}.

\section{Soil}

\subsection{TDR measurements}

Soil water content was measured at both sites using horizontal TDR
probes located at the lowest corner of field.  At Estrup
(figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-theta}) we only have data for 25 cm, at
Silstrup (figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-theta}) we have for 25, 60 and 110 cm
below soil surface.  The 110 cm probe values show two distinct curves
when plotted as points rather than lines.  The variation on the 60 cm
probe seem to bear little relationship to the seasons.  The 25 cm
probes at both sites are a better match for our expectations.  The
ability of the crop to dry out the soil at both sites are larger than
the simulated.  Also, the simulated high (wither) level at Silstrup is
slightly above the measured high level.

In general, we didn't want to calibrate our soil physics based on
these measurements (e.g.\ by lowering the porosity of the Silstrup Ap
horizon), as the soil physics were based on samples from different
parts of the field, and as such more likely to be representative of
the field as a whole, than the TDR measurements.  However, as the
bromide leaching data for Silstrup also lead to us to believe that we
underestimated the crop ability to extract water from the top horizon
(containing most of the bromide during the summer), two changes were
made.  The residual water of the B horizon was set to 8\% (up from 0),
and the crop was calibrated to most of the roots would be concentrated
in the Ap horizon.

\subsection{Suction cups and horizontal filters}

Bromide and pesticide concentration in soil water was measured with
suction cells one meter below surface at the same place the TDR's were
installed, and 3.5 meter below surface with horizontal filters.  The
suction cup measurements are unlikely to be representative for the
field as a whole, due to the large heterogeneity observed.  The
horizontal filters on the other hand have been places downstream in
the expected general direction of groundwater flow, and should thus be
more likely to represent the entire field.

As Daisy keep separate track of solutes in small and large pores (see
section~\ref{sec:fast-slow}), and it is likely that the suction cups
will predominately extract water from the large pores, we have
provided simulation results for concentration in large pores alone, as
well as concentration in total soil water.  Simulated and measured
bromide in both suction cells and filters are shown for Silstrup on
figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-bromide} and Estrup on
figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-bromide}.  The simulated values for 1 meter are
well within the variation shown by the the suction cups.  The
measurements does hint that the first bromide should arrive earlier
though, especially in Silstrup.  The concentration in the large pores
compared to average does not change this picture.  In variation
between the two is short lived in the time scale of the graphs.  For
3.5 meter the simulation is still within the general variation,
however the filters clearly show that some bromide find its way to 3.5
meter very fast (two month after application).

We did not got pesticide measurement data for 3.5 meter depth in time
for this report, but none were above the detection limit anyway.  This
fit well with the simulated results shown on
figure~\ref{fig:pest-horizontal}.

\section{Drain}

Drain water flow was measured daily.  The measurements of bromide and
pesticides were done using a mixture of two sampling methods.  One is
time time proportional sampling, we samples is taken with specific
time intervals.  The other is flow proportional sampling, where
samples is taken with intervals proportional to the amount of water
flow in the drains.  GEUS has combined the two into a ``best
estimate'' of the total weekly flow, which is what we have used for
calibrating against.

\subsection{Water}

Calibrating the simulated total drain flow over the two season is
``just'' a question of picking the right offset the measured ground
water pressure (see section~\ref{sec:gwt}).  Getting the length of the
drain seasons right is trickier, and involves calibrating the soil
physics.  Drain flow for Silstrup is shown on
figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-drain} and for Estrup on
figure\ref{fig:Estrup-drain}.  For Silstrup the drain season length is
right the first year, but the distribution is much more even in the
simulation, compared to the measurements where the flow more directly
follows the precipitation.  For the second season the simulation
underestimate the start of the season, and compensate by
overestimating the end of the season.  For Estrup we got an overall
good match both season, slightly underestimating the drain flow at the
beginning of the first season, while overestimating the drain flow at
the beginning of the second season.

\subsection{Bromide and metamitron}

Bromide was a challenge to get right, especially for Silstrup, as
described in section~\ref{sec:cal-silstrup-bromide}.  For Silstrup
(figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-weekly} and~\ref{fig:Silstrup-bromide-acc})
we get a good match the first year, but the second year the dynamics
are off even if the total amount is right.  The poor second year
dynamics for bromide likely reflect the poor second year dynamics for
water.  Foe Estrup (figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-bromide-drain}), we
underestimate both the initial leaching the first season, and the
leaching the entire second season.

Metamitron is one of the two pesticides we have interesting data for,
unfortunately only for one site.  By increasing the \kd{} parameter to
the largest value we could defend by literature (see
section~\ref{sec:cal-metamitron}) we were able to get a good match
with both weekly (figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-weekly}) and accumulated
(figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-bromide-acc}) measured numbers.  The
accumulated numbers may seem off, but that is only due to two weeks
where the majority of leaching in the simulation occurs, but where the
actual drain water were not analyzed for metamitron.

\subsection{Glyphosate,  fenpropimorph, and dimethoate}

The second interesting pesticide is glyphosate, here presented
together with fenpropimorph and dimethoate.  As can be seen on
figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-acc} and figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-acc} we get
the total amount right for both sites.  The weekly numbers show that
dynamic is also reasonable in Estrup (figure~\ref{fig:Estrup-weekly}),
but that Silstrup overestimate the initial event compared to later
leaching (figure~\ref{fig:Silstrup-weekly2}).  The Silstrup simulated
results required a lot of focus on surface processes (see
section~\ref{sec:cal-silstrup-surface}) to obtain, while the late
numbers are a result of adjusting the pesticide sorption model (see
section~\ref{sec:cal-glyphosate}).  No (additional) adjustment where
made for Estrup.

There is a single measurement at the detection limit of dimethoate at
Silstrup.  The simulation has three spikes at roughly the same size,
one of them matching the detection.  There are no measurements of
dimethoate above detection limit at Estrup, and none for fenpropimorph
at either site.  The simulation results are in agreement with this.
